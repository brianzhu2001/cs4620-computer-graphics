# CS 4620 Assignment 2

Instructions/info about our code:

- The IK system is n-joint, but the maximum number is limited by the "depth" static variable in Kinematics.js which can be changed if needed.
- The particle view classes are KaleidescopeView and FreeFallView, which represent explicit and implicit particle systems, respectively.
